#Rick and Morty App

Create a mobile app using the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/).
We'll be looking at the quality of your code and how your approach would scale to a larger
project. **Code quality is much more important than adding extra features.**

##Requirements

###Functional Requirements
- After launching, the app should display characters, using the `/character` endpoint.
  - For each character show a thumbnail, name and the amount of episodes the
character appeared in.
  - Display 20 characters.
- User should be able to search for a character by name.
- Tapping on a character should display a detailed view, with:
  - Photo/Image
  - Name
  - Status
  - Species
  - Gender
  - Current location
  
###Technical Requirements
- Make use of the Rick and Morty REST API.
- Use your own code to communicate with the API (ie. do not use a 3rd party Rick and
Morty SDK).
- Git should be used and a Github/Bitbucket/etc link should be provided to the completed
exercise. If providing the public link is problematic, provide your exercise as an archive that includes the git repository.
